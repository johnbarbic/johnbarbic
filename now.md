## What I'm doing now

### Reading
Here is what is in the queue:
*  The third book in the Mortal Engines Quartet, Infernal Devices by Phillip Reeve. (Currently reading)
* A Steep Price by Robert Dugoni.
* The Outsider by Stephen King.

### Writing
* [Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/) - I code for fun and this is project I've been watching and playing with for over a year.  I'm keen on using technology and static sites in particular to advance non-profits.  I'm writing a couple of things.
  1. A primer on taking a basic starter and turning it into a website for a hypothetical site called The Gallon Club, a hypothetical business devoted to advancing blood donation. (Currently working on this.)
  2. A _real_ website to help people with multiple sclerosis learn about disease modifying therapies.  (Not sure what to call this one just yet.)
* I also code for business and have been trying to determine how to support an existing legacy application while at the same time be able to stand up new apps.  The legacy application is an enterprise management system written in a mixture of Lucee (CFML)  and Java using a MySQL database.  And the new app(s) are written with React and Node.  At the moment the challenge is decomposing the legacy app into microservices that will communicate with the new app(s).  However, I think I've found a big piece of my solution...
   1. [Loopback](https://loopback.io/) - I'm currently learning how to develop REST APIs and compose extended models in the framwork.  My hope is to create APIs that can support any app using our common database.  
   2. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The application is quite large so learning how to scaling node is another area of learning for me.
   3. React - React can be written as a regular Javascipt class or as a ES6 class, which exposes addition features.  I keep learning as I write more.
