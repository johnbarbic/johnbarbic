**Henslowe:** Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain about the software business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

**Fennyman:** So what do we do?

**Henslowe:** Nothing. Strangely enough, it all turns out well.

**Fennyman:** How?

**Henslowe:** I don't know. It's a mystery.
