If you follow chess like I do, you might delight in this term I saw on Twitter this week, "woodpushers."  It's a term given to the critics complaining about the number of draws in this year's championship.   To which another commenter replied, "They probably complain about precision surgery too." And another, "Why aren't there more mistakes?? We want mistakes!!!"
Someone I love is gravely ill tonight and it's these little distractions that keep me sane.
