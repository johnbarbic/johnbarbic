My memory this day will be of waking up early on a foggy morning, drinking hot coffee and watching the EPL, children constructing legos and playing with toys while the cat does his best to turn himself into a cinnamon roll on the couch, and the snow.  The snow came as a pleasant suprise today after the crush of activity around Christmas.  In other words, it's fine day to relax the mind and take life in for a change.  Working in information and software often takes it toll in the amount of mind share we give to the real world and as I begin to engage more with this microblog of mine I want to capture this stuff.  Years from now I wont remember what project I was doing this month, but I hope I remember the warmth of this day.
