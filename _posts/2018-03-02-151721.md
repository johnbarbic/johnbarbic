At the end of the second Ghostbusters movie Rick Moranis's character Louis Tully has acquired a portable cyclotron and has been dutifully blasting away at the slime barrier around the museum when it finally explodes and frees the rest of the gang.  At one point someone turns and goes, "Hey, you're a Ghostbuster!" And he just stands there nodding his head in this excited little way and goes, "I'm a Ghostbuster!"  **That** is the feeling you get when you pull something like this off.   The other bit that was exciting about doing this is actually breaking the equivalent of the 4th Wall and peering into the box itself.   I don't miss PCs, but I do lament the fact that with mobile computing we rarely if ever get into the machine anymore.  I suppose it's not unlike old gear heads lamenting the fact that they can't turn newer cars into hot rods.  The fact is we're becoming more removed from the very thing that makes software possible, but that is where it lives, right there, in the shot below.

The new battery is in its place and 5 years of dust & cruftage has been dutifully blown out of the chassis. I guess I'm a computer repairman now...
