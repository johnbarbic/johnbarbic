Reading this morning I came upon this word, [licentious.](https://www.wordnik.com/words/licentious)  

Licentious - adjective

1. Lacking moral discipline or ignoring legal restraint, especially in sexual conduct. 
2. Having no regard for accepted rules or standards.

And it became my word of the day.
