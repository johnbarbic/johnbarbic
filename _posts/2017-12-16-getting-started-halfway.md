Just finished the last major release of the year at work and now I am thinking about what I want to do with this ole blog.  For many months now I have dabbled on and off, and played with some formatting and tested pages, but I haven't started, not really.

One of the reasons I backed micro.blog is that I liked the idea of simply writing more, and writing more simply without all the baggage that comes with social networks.  I started this year by walking away from my facebook account because it felt unhealthy to me.  And almost a year on, it's reaffirming to read articles that advance those feelings in tangible ways.  So what is the difference with micro.blog?  I think the difference is captured in something Manton wrote about owning your own short form writing.  Owning your words, and paying a nominal fee to be read (assuming anyone does this), simply feels better.  Ownership is something that comes with a price and perhaps that is one of the ways to keep ourselves writing from a place of humility, empathy, and simplicity.  I confess I was not always happy with the person I was on facebook and I hope to be better if I should keep this up.  

My hope is that I create some body of writing that has value to me. In the same way photos become a stanchion of memory, my writing may help me to remember.  Or perhaps I will write something of value to others.  I have no idea, but it will be interesting to do this and see what happens.

So what do I do now?  I guess the answer is to get started...
