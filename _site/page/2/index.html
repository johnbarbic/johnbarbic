		<h1><a href="/2018/02/28/replacing-the-battery.html">Replacing the Battery in an Early 2013 MacBook Pro - Prologue</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>I am going to share my experience replacing the battery in my Macbook Pro, and to do that properly I have written this prologue so you understand my perspective and why I was compelled to take the plunge.  This kind of operation is not for everyone and I think some might question why anyone would take the risk - so let me start right there before getting into it.</p>

<p>Current owners of contemporary MacBook Pros are in an interesting spot.  Here, I am referring to those of us who bought the unibody version that included SSD hard drives almost exclusively.  In my case, I am specifically referring to an early 2013 Retina 15 inch MBP with a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 500 GB hard drive that is my primary development machine.  I believe a fair number of us purchase Apple computers to enjoy the best experience and to claim a small measure of future proofing that is not available elsewhere.  Obviously, five years is decent life for any computer, but at this particular juncture our group is confronted with a stark reality - Apple took its eyes off the MacBook Pro in the intervening years and  while we might be ready to upgrade, we‚Äôre left wanting now.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the latest version of the MacBook Pro is simply not up to the same standard as its ancestry.  Setting aside dongle hell, the revision to the key board and the absence of MagSafe are deal killers. First, like any professional, my muscle memory and feel for the laptop‚Äôs keys is acute. So if you‚Äôre going to remove a key, or change the feel of the keyboard and require me to relearn the layout of my work home, it better come with some study of the benefits which can be explained to me in no uncertain terms.  And Second, MagSafe. That little invention has saved me so many times.  Were I to purchase $4,000.00 replacement and see it fly into the ground because I tripped over the power cord (again) it would cause me so much grief that I might just quit the game entirely.</p>

<p>And all of that written, I want to further preface this by asking you to imagine a loyal customer entering the Apple store at the Flatirons Mall just outside of Boulder Colorado to inquire about a simple battery replacement.  Imagine the brush off from some kid in a brightly colored genius t-shirt telling him that his computer is ‚Äúvintage, if not obsolete,‚Äù and making every not so subtle effort to get him out the door as quickly as possible (I have never felt more unwelcome in an Apple store in my life).  Absolutely no awareness or sensitivity to the predicament this customer is in whatsoever, not even a passing desire to take his money for the work.  <em>‚ÄúNo, mister you are a pilgrim in an unholy land of shiny new things, and, you sir, are not wanted here. You only have two options, do it yourself or trust some third-party shop to fix your rig with whatever backup, wipe, get it fixed, and restore, delay that might entail‚Ä¶‚Äú</em> I was walking out of the there shaking my head, and I love Apple.  And I wish I could buy the latest MacBook Pro, but I just won‚Äôt do it.</p>

<p>And one more thing‚Ä¶</p>

<p>This ‚Äúvintage, if not obsolete‚Äù machine of mine?  Oh patronizing young genius let me tell you a little about myself:  I‚Äôm what you call a full stack guy. On any given day I‚Äôm running a JVM and MySQL while also running an IDE, BBEdit, Navicat, Email, WhatsApp, iMessage, one or more MS Office Programs, Postmam, iTerm, and a browser with more tabs than any human being should ever have open at the same time, all while blissfully listening to iTunes continuously!  And that‚Äôs not when I also have a VM running Windows just so I can debug some one-off IE bug one of my users discovered. And this little rig runs <em>all of it</em> without observable delay.  Vintage, sure I accept that with pride.  Obsolete?  No sir, this keyboard has the feel of a well worn leather couch, and see this little magnetic doodad? It‚Äôs my own little super hero which has saved me so many tears I would sooner have you pry this <em>obsolete</em> machine from my cold dead hands than settle.  I am in this because Apple conditioned me to expect the absolute best and then delivered a squib.  No worries. I am not complaining, it happens to the best of us.  I‚Äôm still loyal.  <em>All</em> I wanted was a little help while waiting patiently for the day when I don‚Äôt have to settle.  That‚Äôs all.  If you would like to understand why anyone would take this sort of risk there are many reasons.  For me though, it‚Äôs because I refuse to settle.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>My memory this day will be of waking up early on a foggy morning, drinking hot coffee and watching the EPL, children constructing legos and playing with toys while the cat does his best to turn himself into a cinnamon roll on the couch, and the snow.  The snow came as a pleasant suprise today after the crush of activity around Christmas.  In other words, it‚Äôs fine day to relax the mind and take life in for a change.  Working in information and software often takes it toll in the amount of mind share we give to the real world and as I begin to engage more with this microblog of mine I want to capture this stuff.  Years from now I wont remember what project I was doing this month, but I hope I remember the warmth of this day.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/12/16/getting-started-halfway.html">Getting started halfway through my first year on micro.blog</a></h1>
	  
      <div class="e-content"><p>Just finished the last major release of the year at work and now I am thinking about what I want to do with this ole blog.  For many months now I have dabbled on and off, and played with some formatting and tested pages, but I haven‚Äôt started, not really.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I backed micro.blog is that I liked the idea of simply writing more, and writing more simply without all the baggage that comes with social networks.  I started this year by walking away from my facebook account because it felt unhealthy to me.  And almost a year on, it‚Äôs reaffirming to read articles that advance those feelings in tangible ways.  So what is the difference with micro.blog?  I think the difference is captured in something Manton wrote about owning your own short form writing.  Owning your words, and paying a nominal fee to be read (assuming anyone does this), simply feels better.  Ownership is something that comes with a price and perhaps that is one of the ways to keep ourselves writing from a place of humility, empathy, and simplicity.  I confess I was not always happy with the person I was on facebook and I hope to be better if I should keep this up.</p>

<p>My hope is that I create some body of writing that has value to me. In the same way photos become a stanchion of memory, my writing may help me to remember.  Or perhaps I will write something of value to others.  I have no idea, but it will be interesting to do this and see what happens.</p>

<p>So what do I do now?  I guess the answer is to get started‚Ä¶</p>
