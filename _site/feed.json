			"content_html": "<p>I‚Äôm experimenting now with the phone app. Here I‚Äôm adding five photos to show how I made a Mac Daddy pizza.  I‚Äôm curious if I can add them here and edit the post and place text between them later.  In other words, how do multiple photos get organized in a single post and how can the author organize them if at all?  It‚Äôs an interesting trying to communicate with words and photos. It shows how the platform can impact the writing.  Support for photos sounds easy at first, but support for multiple photos leads interesting design decisions both for the platform and the user.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure what right answer is when it comes to placement so this is a way of discovering how we can use micro.blog through the clever use of food porn.</p>\n\n<p>Awesome! So after you post multiple photos through the phone app, you can then edit the post on the web to interject prose inline, that is fantastic.  So what is a Mac Daddy?</p>\n\n<p>It begins by getting a plain take and bake cheese pizza, browning about 3/4 pound of ground beef, and then sprinkling that throughout the cheese.  I also add slices of onion.  Bake at 425 for 10 minutes.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.barbic.com/uploads/2018/4e93f324f0.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>While the pie is baking, remove the core from an iceberg lettuce‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.barbic.com/uploads/2018/032f2dea8a.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>‚Ä¶and chop that sucker up.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.barbic.com/uploads/2018/b34acfc0c9.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>When the pie is done baking, use Thousand Island dressing to make a nice swirl of yumminess throughout the cheesy beefy oniony crust.  Then distribute the lettuce and add chopped tomatoes to your liking.  Add another swirl of Thousand Island to finish it off.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.barbic.com/uploads/2018/b3564b1f19.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>The end result is the Mac Daddy.  So named because it tastes like a better version of a Big Mac.  It‚Äôs kid tested and perfect for movie nights.  Now, wasn‚Äôt this a fun way to see what you can do with muliple photos in a single post on micro.blog?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.barbic.com/uploads/2018/5b3cb60751.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"599\" /></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Once you have decided to take action, the biggest problem is determining how to actually go about it. I am not a hardware guy, but after some research, I came across the iFixit website and found <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Early+2013+Battery+Replacement/90275\">this tutorial on battery replacement.</a>.  It looked crazy difficult to me, but I proceeded to purchase the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/MacBook-Pro-15-Inch-Retina-Mid-2012-Early-2013-Battery/IF117-047-4\">appropriate kit for my computer.</a>  The delivery took 5 days and I used that time to read and reread the tutorial.  After several reads, I read the comments in Step 4 - ‚ÄúUsing the flat end of a spudger, gently pry the battery connector straight up out of its socket on the logic board.‚Äù  One commenter explained how he simply skipped the majority of the tutorial and had success.  Looking over the entire procedure it turns out that the majority of it involves taking the entire computer apart simply to prevent any chance of damaging the contents with the liquid adhesive remover.  While I waited for the kit to arrive I began rolling that particular thought around in my mind.</p>\n\n<p>The kit arrived just before I left for a weekend getaway and so the first thing I did was to leave my laptop running so as to drain the battery completely.  Upon my return, I resolved to take the short cut described in the comments.  If you ever do this and refer to the same tutorial, the steps I took were Step 1 through Step 4, Step 35 (very important), and then simply set about prying the battery out of its cradle.  This involved working from the outside in, prying up the two outermost cells on each side.  Using the spudger and the card it‚Äôs possible to work from the edges toward the center of each cell and break the adhesive bonds without use of the liquid adhesive remover.</p>\n\n<p>The picture shows the first cell I was able to pry up along with plastic card getting up under the second cell.  Note the, ‚ÄúRepair is noble.‚Äù Once I was able to get the first two up, I was confident enough to do the rest. I‚Äôm using the web version of micro.blog so I will need to show some additional pictures in separate posts, but lets end Part One here.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.barbic.com/uploads/2018/4a519656d3.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",
