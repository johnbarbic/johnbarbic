      <p>Once you have decided to take action, the biggest problem is determining how to actually go about it. I am not a hardware guy, but after some research, I came across the iFixit website and found <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Early+2013+Battery+Replacement/90275">this tutorial on battery replacement.</a>.  It looked crazy difficult to me, but I proceeded to purchase the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/MacBook-Pro-15-Inch-Retina-Mid-2012-Early-2013-Battery/IF117-047-4">appropriate kit for my computer.</a>  The delivery took 5 days and I used that time to read and reread the tutorial.  After several reads, I read the comments in Step 4 - “Using the flat end of a spudger, gently pry the battery connector straight up out of its socket on the logic board.”  One commenter explained how he simply skipped the majority of the tutorial and had success.  Looking over the entire procedure it turns out that the majority of it involves taking the entire computer apart simply to prevent any chance of damaging the contents with the liquid adhesive remover.  While I waited for the kit to arrive I began rolling that particular thought around in my mind.</p>

<p>The kit arrived just before I left for a weekend getaway and so the first thing I did was to leave my laptop running so as to drain the battery completely.  Upon my return, I resolved to take the short cut described in the comments.  If you ever do this and refer to the same tutorial, the steps I took were Step 1 through Step 4, Step 35 (very important), and then simply set about prying the battery out of its cradle.  This involved working from the outside in, prying up the two outermost cells on each side.  Using the spudger and the card it’s possible to work from the edges toward the center of each cell and break the adhesive bonds without use of the liquid adhesive remover.</p>

<p>The picture shows the first cell I was able to pry up along with plastic card getting up under the second cell.  Note the, “Repair is noble.” Once I was able to get the first two up, I was confident enough to do the rest. I’m using the web version of micro.blog so I will need to show some additional pictures in separate posts, but lets end Part One here.</p>
